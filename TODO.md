# Schedule Toggle System Implementation

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Schedule Utilities (`src/utils/scheduleUtils.js`)
- âœ… `isCurrentDateInExamPeriod()` - Checks if current date falls within exam periods
- âœ… `isDateInExamPeriod()` - **NEW**: Checks if any date in a given range falls within exam periods
- âœ… `useLocalStorage()` - Custom hook for localStorage with error handling
- âœ… `getInitialToggleState()` - Determines initial toggle state based on exam periods and user preferences

### 2. Updated All Components with Toggle Switches
- âœ… **FacultyDetail.jsx** - Updated to use localStorage and auto-select examination mode
- âœ… **DepartmentSchedule.jsx** - Updated to use localStorage and auto-select examination mode
- âœ… **RoomSchedule.jsx** - Updated to use localStorage and auto-select examination mode
- âœ… **BlockSchedule.jsx** - Updated to use localStorage and auto-select examination mode
- âœ… **ViewsSession.jsx** - **UPDATED**: Now checks week dates for exam periods, shows "Exam Period Detected" badge
- âœ… **VisualMap.jsx** - **UPDATED**: Now checks week dates for exam periods, shows "Exam Period Detected" badge

### 3. Fixed Week Display Logic (`src/utils/week.js`)
- âœ… **getCurrentWeekDays()** - Fixed to show next week when today is Sunday, current week otherwise

### 4. Enhanced Auto-Detection System
- âœ… **Smart Date Range Detection**: System now checks if ANY of the displayed week dates fall within exam periods
- âœ… **Visual Indicators**: Added "Exam Period Detected" badges when exam periods are detected in the displayed week
- âœ… **Improved User Experience**: Users can see when exam periods are coming up in the current view

### 5. Key Features Implemented
- âœ… **Automatic Detection**: System automatically switches to examination mode when current date falls within exam periods
- âœ… **Date Range Awareness**: **NEW**: System now checks the entire week displayed in tabs, not just today
- âœ… **Persistent Preferences**: User toggle preferences are saved in localStorage
- âœ… **Smart Fallbacks**: If user manually sets examination mode, it respects that choice even outside exam periods
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for localStorage operations
- âœ… **Consistent UX**: All components now have unified toggle behavior
- âœ… **Correct Week Display**: Shows next week when today is Sunday, current week otherwise
- âœ… **Visual Feedback**: Shows "Exam Period Detected" badge when exam dates are in the displayed week

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits Achieved

1. **Enhanced Auto-Detection**: System now detects exam periods based on the actual dates shown in the UI tabs
2. **Better User Experience**: Users get visual feedback when exam periods are detected in their current view
3. **Proactive Notifications**: "Exam Period Detected" badges alert users to upcoming exam schedules
4. **Consistency**: All views now have synchronized toggle behavior
5. **Persistence**: User preferences are remembered across sessions
6. **Intelligence**: System automatically detects exam periods from academic calendar
7. **Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms ensure the system works even if data is missing
8. **Correct Scheduling**: Week display now shows the appropriate week based on current day

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

- **Storage Keys**: Each component uses unique localStorage keys to maintain independent preferences
- **Data Integration**: Leverages existing academic calendar data for exam period detection
- **React Hooks**: Custom hook provides clean API for localStorage management
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of localStorage errors and missing data
- **Smart Week Logic**: Automatically adjusts week display based on current day of week
- **Date Range Checking**: **NEW**: Checks entire week range instead of just current date

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Instructions

To test the enhanced auto-detection:

1. **Modify Academic Calendar**: Update dates in `public/acadcalendar.json` to match your current week
2. **Check Auto-Detection**: The system should automatically detect exam periods in the displayed week
3. **Visual Indicators**: Look for "Exam Period Detected" badges when exam dates are in the current view
4. **Toggle Behavior**: Test that manual toggle overrides still work correctly

## ðŸ“… Example Test Case

If your current week shows:
- Monday: September 22, 2025
- Tuesday: September 23, 2025
- Wednesday: September 24, 2025
- Thursday: September 25, 2025
- Friday: September 26, 2025

And you set an exam date to "September 24, 2025" in the academic calendar, the system should:
- Show "Exam Period Detected" badge
- Auto-switch to examination mode (if not manually overridden)
- Display exam data for Wednesday when in examination mode

**Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE**

All components now have intelligent, persistent toggle behavior that automatically detects exam periods based on the displayed week dates and provides visual feedback to users. Week display logic has been fixed to show the correct week based on the current day.
